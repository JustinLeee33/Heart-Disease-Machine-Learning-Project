## Project Structure
The repository is structured as follows:

- **train.py**: The main script to run the data processing pipeline, model training, and evaluation.
- **src/**: Contains all the supporting modules for data preprocessing, model training, and visualization.
    - **src/preprocessing.py**: Functions for data cleaning, handling missing values, and converting categorical data to integer mappings.
    - **src/download.py**: A utility to download and extract the heart disease dataset from Kaggle.
    - **src/visualization.py**: Functions to generate visual plots and gain insights into the dataset.
    - **src/logistic_regression.py**: Implements the logistic regression model training and evaluation.
    - **src/decision_tree.py**: Code to train and evaluate a decision tree classifier.
    - **src/random_forest.py**: Code for training and evaluating a random forest model.
    - **src/gradient_boosting.py**: Gradient boosting model training and evaluation.
    - **src/svm.py**: Support Vector Machine (SVM) training and evaluation.
    - **src/xgboost_model.py**: Implements training and evaluation for an XGBoost model.
    - **src/automl.py**: Integrates an AutoML approach using TPOT to automatically find the best model configuration.
- **requirements.txt**: Lists all the dependencies required for running the project.
- **README.md**: Provides an overview and detailed information about the project.
- **.gitignore**: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Heart-Disease-Machine-Learning-Project.git
   cd Heart-Disease-Machine-Learning-Project
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Ensure that you have access to Kaggle's API credentials to download the dataset.

## How to Run the Project
1. **Download and Prepare Data**:
   Ensure that your Kaggle credentials are set up properly. Run the main training script:
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```

2. **Train Models**:
   The script will process the data, train multiple models, and evaluate their performance, including:
   - Logistic Regression
   - Decision Tree
   - Random Forest
   - Gradient Boosting
   - SVM
   - XGBoost
   - AutoML using TPOT

3. **View Results**:
   Evaluation results, including confusion matrices and precision-recall curves, are stored in the `data/plots/` directory.

## Key Features
- **Comprehensive Preprocessing**: Handles missing data, encodes categorical variables, and scales numerical features.
- **Multiple Model Support**: Trains various classifiers and compares their performance.
- **AutoML Integration**: TPOT is used to automate the search for the best model and hyperparameters.
- **Visualization**: Precision-recall curves and confusion matrices are plotted for detailed evaluation.
- **Category Mapping**: The project maps categorical features to integers for seamless model input, and prints mappings for traceability.

## Data Preparation
The dataset is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/redwankarimsony/heart-disease-data). It includes patient data with various features related to cardiovascular health. Missing values are handled using mean imputation for numerical columns.

## Example Output
**Sample Category Mappings**:
```python
Category Mappings:
{
    'sex': {0: 'Male', 1: 'Female'},
    'cp': {0: 'Typical Angina', 1: 'Atypical Angina', 2: 'Non-anginal Pain', 3: 'Asymptomatic'},
    ...
}
```
